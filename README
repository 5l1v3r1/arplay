-------==[ ARPLAY v0.1 ] ==-------

I. Introduction:
----------------

ARPLAY is a small tool to play with the ARP protocol. You can perform a MITM, DoS and ARP Queries using it.
It is based on arpspoof from dsniff tools and has been almost completely remade, to work with libnet 1.X, bringing some "cool" stuff and performances.

II. How to compile it?
----------------------
You do not need to configure anything, just to compile it using your favourite compiler (by default GCC):
ex: gcc arplay.c -o arplay -lnet -lpcap

III. How to use it?
-------------------
Good question! If the helper does not help you, you have to read a little about this tool here.

First and foremost, when you are using for the first time, you will find a little helper like this :
==================================================+
Usage: arpspoof [-s host] [-t target] interface

Option: -f <Change MAC address source>
==================================================+ 
All you have to do, is to write the source's ip for "-s" and target's ip for "-t" options. Don't forget to precise which interface you would like to use for your injections.

There is another option "-f", if you would like to perform a DoS or just forward traffic for another host.
